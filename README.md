# Modeling conformity of SAR

Species-area relationships are foundational to ecology and biogeography, yet small islands often deviate from predictable scaling. This high stochasticity in small-island species-area relationships is typically disregarded as unexplained noise or attributed to idiosyncratic extinction rates. Here, we introduce a statistical framework that explicitly incorporates the stochasticity in species-area relationships as a model parameter. Using a global island plant dataset for atolls (378 islands across 19 atolls) – prototypical examples for small-island dynamics – we reveal that rainfall, not cyclone disturbances, predictably modulates stochasticity in species-area relationships. Atolls receiving higher rainfall exhibit increasingly predictable species-area relationships, i.e., lower stochasticity around the species-area curve. Our findings challenge the widely held view that stochasticity in small-island species-area relationships is due to disturbance regimes, instead favouring resource limitation as a cause. Explicitly modelling stochasticity in species-area studies offers a promising novel tool for investigating the environmental factors influencing the conformity to the law of species-area scaling. 

## Workflow

We compiled island-level biodiversity data for 19 atolls from literature reports, along with cumulative annual rainfall measurements and the frequency of tropical cyclone encounters per atoll.
We then computed the species-area relationship (SAR) following Arrhenius' Power Law, which relates island species richness S to island area A through a log-log linear relationship with intercept c and slope z.
Then, we determined the effect of rainfall and cyclone disturbance frequency on the slope parameter and the residual error in the species-area relationship, using Bayesian Distributional Modelling (i.e., Bayesian Heteroscedastic Modelling).
We tested the hypotheses that higher rainfall amounts reduce the residual error (i.e. the ‘noise’) in species-area relationship, and increase the slope of the relationship.
